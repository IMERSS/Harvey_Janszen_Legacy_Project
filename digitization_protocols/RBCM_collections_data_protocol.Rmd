Ideas:

1)  UTM coordinates in their database seem to be accurate even when not in field notes... ? who should we trust. Could Harvey have put those in after (e.g. Wood duck pond saturna)
2)  When collection numbers not in RBCM database, check that not in UBC database?
3)  Things I will have to standardize from data entry template
4)  Standardization between occurrence data and RBCM data?
5)  In GBIF data, things I have issues with:
    -   "individualCount = 1 for all of them" - what if actual abundance given?

    -   all caps sp presence or absence
6)
