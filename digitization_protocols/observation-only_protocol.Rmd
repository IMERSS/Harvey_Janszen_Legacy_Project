# Data entry template

Start new template for every field journal? and then combine into one? is that easier or more complicated?

(meta data/ information about how info should be entered in each column, matching notes in excel file)

# Entering data

-   Start with first name on page...

-   Number each page with pencil at top?

-   tips about copying rows and counting how many entries needed for a given time and place - easier to copy a bunch of that info between rows

-   iNaturalist tips

    -   place of interest box around southern BC- gulf islands, vancouver, up to N coast of vancouver island

    -   start entering first 3 letters of generic name and species name

    -   see if it occurs in the region

    -   keep trying with different letters to find best match

    -   if multiple species and can't decipher, keep note in dataentry renarks column

    -   start typing name into bar and finish typing and if the option still pops up then its proper spelling and you can copy it to spreadsheet

    -   WHAT TO DO IF SUBSPECIES?

-   don't enter ones will colleciton number of "coll no \#"

-   don't enter repeated observations of same taxa at same locality , same habitat and same date

-   entry everything that could be considered an occurrence except for collected specimens (indicated with collection numbers). If certain names can't be deciphered or a location/ time can't be attributed to it, still include as a row in the template, and can be removed later (this will help for re-finding things on the page)

-   When it comes to big chunks where most observations associated with collections - only write down ones that aren't a collection at that locality - be careful it can sometimes be tricky, but can write down corodinates for collected specimen for the occurrence

# Metadata

-   Abundance codes: from HJ-7 field journal

    -   "+" = 1

    -   "1" = 1-5

    -   "2" = 5-25

    -   "3" = 25-50"

    -   "4" = 50-75

    -   "5" = 75+
