# Data entry template

*Start new template for every field journal.*

-   Copy and paste the template "HJ-occ-entry-template.xlsx"

-   Rename to "HJ-[input archiveID]-occ-entry-[YY-MM-DD].xlsx"

# Setting up 

1.  Open the data entry excel sheet

2.  Open the field journal to the first page

3.  Open two internet search windows

4.  In the first window --\> [https://www.inaturalist.org](https://www.inaturalist.org/home)

    -   click "Explore" tab

    -   zoom in on south western BC

    -   click the red rectangular select button

    -   Click and drag to select an area that extends from around Hope BC to the east, encompasses all of Vancouver Island, and goes down to Seattle/ Tacoma in the south

    -   set this window aside and return to excel sheet

5.  Second window will be used to search up localities that you are uncertain of

# Entering data

Begin with the **first page in a journal.**

1.  Denote the **archive ID** (number on front of journal e.g. HJ-7 --\> "7" (number only))

2.  Enter **pageNum** (page number) --\> e.g 1 . (circled ain bottom corner of pages)

3.  **Scan the page for observations (species names)** starting at the top of the page. All species names are acceptable, except for entries which have a collection number beside them (or say "coll" indicating a collection).

    -   This could be in a **set of species names observed at a particular location** (with no collection numbers)

    -   **OR the name of a species in the description of a collected specimen (associated speecies occurrence)**  - in this case, just make sure that if there are multiple collected specimens from that location, that one of these associated species was not collected. If it was, do not include it as an observation in a row. The occurrence of this species would be documented in the herbarium and uploaded to GBIF.

    -   Normally, he would put a location and a date and then species associated with it BELOW or BESIDE

4.  Enter **numPage** (number on page) as the number of the observation on the page (e.g. the first species name that matches the criteria in step 3 gets "1", the next one "2", etc.)

5.  **vName** = the verbatim name written in the notes

    -   this may be an abbreviation (e.g. Stel med)

    -   or full species name (could be misspelt, include spelling mistakes)

    -   or a full species name which is outdated

6.  **vSciName** = your esitmation of what the full species name is

    -   This is where iNaturalist is helpful. Often the taxonomy might be outdated (indicated by a bracketed name in the search results on iNat). Click on the top result. Does it occur in the region?

        -   start entering first 3 letters of generic name and species name

        -   see if it occurs in the region

        -   keep trying with different letters to find best match

        -   if multiple species and can't decipher, keep note in dataEntryRemarks column (e.g. "could not decipher taxon name")

        -   Once you are reasonably certain of a full name, start typing it into search bar and finish typing by looking at the result. If the result still pops up then its proper spelling and you can copy it to spreadsheet

    -   Enter your best guess of what the full verbatim name was meant to be

    -   there should be no spelling mistakes, but outdated taxon names should still be used here

7.  **Conf** = enter your confidence level in the taxon name estimate (low = l, medium = m, high = h)

    -   the entries with low confidence will be returned to once all of the occurrences have been entered

    -   entries with medium confidence may be returned to if there is time

8.  **sciName =** full, properly spelt, updated taxon names.

    -   refer to iNaturalist for updates taxon names

    -   If subspecies or variety, just include this epiphet, and do not include the "ssp." or "var." abbreviations. (e.g. Instead of Lupinus latifolius ssp. subalpinus, put "Lupinus latifolius subalpinus")

9.  **vTaxonRank** = The most specific level of taxonomy provided verbatim. Only use if the verbatim taxon name is a family name or higher. If genus, species or subspecies, then this information will be filled in later automatically

    -   e.g. if "Brassicaceae" --\> put "family"

10. **occStatus =** occurrence status (either present of absent)

    -   to save time, only enter if there is a note clearly saying "absent"

    -   otherwise, assume the species was observed (present) and you do not need to fill this in

11. **date =** fill in YYYYMMDD

12. **locality =** string describing specific location. Does not contain country, province information, but includes place name or position relative to place name and city/town/ municipality/ island

    -   e.g. Mount Sutil, Galiano Island

    -   try to separate terms with commas, and spell out abbreviations

        -   e.g. Mt --\> Mount, Rd --\> Rd

13. **Country =** full name of country of collection (either USA or Canada)

14. **stateProvince =** Full name of province/ state of collection (either British Columbia or Washington)

15. **island =** full name of island (if collected on island)

    -   e.g. Galiano Island, Saltspring Island

    -   must contain the word "Island capitalized"

16. **habitat =** string describing the habitat conditions

    -   you can use commas when listing things

    -   to start a new sentence use a semicolon ";" rather than a period

17. assTaxa = associated taxa (names of associated species), growing at same locality at same time

    -   ONLY denote associated taxa names in this field, if there is a record of a specimen collection (either a collection number or a note about "coll" next to a species name) since these won't be included later but are stored in a separate database (herbarium)

    -   e.g. Stellaria media 2678 --\> "Stellaria media"

    -   use updated and full names of these taxa

    -   use iNaturalist to decipher names/ abbreviations of associated taxa and for updated names

18. **assOcc** = associated occurrences

    -   the collection numbers associated with

19. tips about copying rows and counting how many entries needed for a given time and place - easier to copy a bunch of that info between rows

20. don't enter ones will collection number of "coll no \#"

21. don't enter repeated observations of same taxa at same locality , same habitat and same date

22. entry everything that could be considered an occurrence except for collected specimens (indicated with collection numbers). If certain names can't be deciphered or a location/ time can't be attributed to it, still include as a row in the template, and can be removed later (this will help for re-finding things on the page)

23. When it comes to big chunks where most observations associated with collections - only write down ones that aren't a collection at that locality - be careful it can sometimes be tricky, but can write down corodinates for collected specimen for the occurrence

# Metadata

-   Abundance codes: from HJ-7 field journal

    -   "+" = 1

    -   "1" = 1-5

    -   "2" = 5-25

    -   "3" = 25-50"

    -   "4" = 50-75

    -   "5" = 75+

# Processing step I: data entry checking

1.  Open script " "

2.  Input name of excel sheet for journal that was completed

3.  Run the script

4.  Take the csv file with the errors, get Andrew & Emma to check these over

Take back into the same script to replace updated rows???? - some sort of API/ github feature we could use?

Save as both .xlsx and .csv files !

# Processing step II: data cleaning

1.  Open script "part2-data-cleaning.R"
2.  Input name of completed data sheet
3.  Run the script
4.  Take the csv output file and correct errors (Emma)
5.  Take back to the same script to combine and make clean??

# Processing step III: conversion to Darwin Core fields 

1.  Open script "part3_template-to-dwc.R"

2.  Input name of the completed and cleaned file

3.  Run the script to Part 4.

4.  Follow the instructions in Part 4 to clean taxa names
