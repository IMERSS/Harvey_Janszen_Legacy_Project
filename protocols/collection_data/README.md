# Collection Data workflow

-   Enter and process data for multiple journals at a time following the components listed under the "Collection data" section above

-   The scripts and folder structures are designed in a way where you can just continually add to the entry templates and run the scripts as outlined above and only new rows will be checked, cleaned and converted and added to the previously processed data, so you won't have to repeat these steps for everything multiple times

-   To use this data to review RBCM herbarium data, follow the protocol: "rbcm-data-review-protocol" and perform this review one journal at a time
