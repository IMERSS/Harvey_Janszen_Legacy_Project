# Occurrence Data Workflow

-   Enter data for multiple journals

-   Continue to digitize the journals by adding to the data entry templates in the *"data \> digitized_data \> occurrence_data \> 1_raw_data"* folder

-   Every few weeks, once \~ 500-1000 new rows have been added in total, the processing protocol could be used to check, clean, and convert the data. Alternatively, this protocol could be followed only a few times with large chunks of data, but data checking, taxonomy verification and georeferencing will require larger chunks of time to carry out

-   The scripts and folder structures are designed in a way where you can just continually add to the entry templates and run the scripts as outlined above and only new rows will be checked, cleaned and converted and added to the previously processed data, so you won't have to repeat these steps for everything multiple times
